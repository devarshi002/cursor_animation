# Cursor Trail with Changing Border Colors

This project creates a cursor trail effect with an infinite number of border colors. Each trail element follows the cursor and changes its border color in a continuous loop.

## How It Works

- The project uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create the cursor trail effect.
- Each trail element is a `<div>` with a circular shape and a border.
- JavaScript is used to create new trail elements at the cursor's position and apply an animation that changes the border color.

## Usage

- Move your cursor around the screen to see the cursor trail effect.
- The trail elements will follow the cursor and change their border colors continuously.

## Customization

- You can customize the colors, animation duration, and other styles in the CSS file (`style.css`).
- Modify the JavaScript code (`script.js`) to change the behavior of the cursor trail.
